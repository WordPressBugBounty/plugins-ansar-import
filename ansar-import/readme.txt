üìö How It Works:
Install and activate Ansar Import.

Go to Appearance > Ansar Import.

Select a demo and click "Import."

Your site is ready with demo content and layout.

== Installation ==

1. Install the plugin either via the WordPress.org plugin directory, or by uploading the files to your server (in the /wp-content/plugins/ directory).
2. Activate the Themeansar Demo Importer plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don‚Äôt need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of Ansar Import, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.

In the search field type ‚ÄúAnsar Import‚Äù and click Search Plugins. Once you‚Äôve found our demo importer plugin you can view details about it such as the the point release, rating and description. Most importantly of course, you can install it by simply clicking ‚ÄúInstall Now‚Äù.

= Manual installation =

The manual installation method involves downloading our demo importer plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your favourite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Manual_Plugin_Installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.
